# hello-world
This repository hosts my personal project to analyse the entire pokemon dataset using Python libraries specific to data science like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy etc.
My aim is to extend this project from initial data analysis to include other things like Pokemon Go data scraping and creating interactive data dashboards.
